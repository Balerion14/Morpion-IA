# Morpion-IA
- Tic-tac-toe game with n board size, n alignment, n players, basic AI with a basic algorithm that selects the best move according to the open or closed alignments...

- First AI based on Qlearning with a tic-tac-toe game directly integrated and thus independent from the main one in order to do the tests

- Second AI with Qlearning and neural network with the game engine directly integrated for testing
    - Training phase :
    the games are distributed over all the logical processes available on the PC

Warning : The QLearning + neural network part is being modified to train 2 agents at the same time
